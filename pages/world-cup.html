        <h1>The 2022 Football World Cup!</h1>

        <h2>The biggest event in football!</h2>
        <p>The World Cup is the most prestigious association football tournament in the world, as well as the most
            widely viewed and followed single sporting event in the world. The viewership of the 2018 World Cup was
            estimated to be 3.57 billion (close to half of the global population), while the engagement with 2022 World
            Cup was estimated to be around 5 billion with close to 1.5 billion people watching the final match.</p>

        <h3>History of the World Cup</h3>
        <p>The first official World Cup was played in Uruguay 1930, and since then the tournament has been held every
            fourth year (with some exceptions for interruption due to the Second World War). Within all of those
            tournaments, Brazil holds the record for the most wins, with 5 titles, Germany and Italy are tied in second
            with 4 titles each, with Argentina close behind in third place with 3 titles to date.</p>

                    <h4>How did it begin? Scaloni's arrival to the Argentinian national team</h4>
                    <p>I would account the beginning of Argentina's road to winning the World Cup, with the entry of
                        Lionel Scaloni as the coach of the Argentinian team. Specifically, September 8th, 2018, when
                        Lionel made his debut as interin coach on a friendly match against Guatemala. This was the
                        beginning of a great future of Lionel Scaloni, and the Argentinian national team, which was
                        later referred to as "La Escaloneta". On November 29th of that same year, Scaloni was confirmed
                        as the official coach for the Argentinian national team. This would be the beginning of a great
                        journey for Scaloni and for the Argentinian national team.</p>

                    <p>Despite being Lionel Scaloni's first time coaching a major team, he managed to get excellent
                        result with Argentina's national team. Unfortunately, they lost in the semifinals agains Brazil
                        2-0. They still managed to get the third place in the competition after winning the match for
                        the third place against Chile 2-1.</p>

                    <p>As a small disclosure, the Copa America was intended to be played in 2020, but due to the new
                        pandemic of COVID-19, it was postponed, and it could only properly begin in June 13th, 2021,
                        with an excellent match featuring Argentina vs Chile's national team. This time, the Copa
                        America was not going to slip Scaloni's grasp. Argentina played an admirable streak of winnings,
                        which resulted on the Argentinian football team winning the Copa America 1-0 against Brazil on
                        July 10th, 2021.</p>

                    <h4>Argentina's rocky start in the World Cup</h4>
                    <p>After having an amazing performance in the Copa America 2020/2021, which allowed the Argentinian
                        national, or "La Escaloneta" as it more commonly known, and Escaloni to achieved an amazing
                        streak of 36 matches without losing, they were unfortunately beaten by one of the least expected
                        contenders for the World Cup title. Specifically, on November 22nd, 2022, Argentina faced Saudi
                        Arabia on an unprecedented match, which saw the end of "La Escaloneta" streak and saw the
                        Argentinian national team lose 2-0. This was definitely a rocky start, but nothing that could
                        not be shaken off by their next results, as this was the last match that Argentina would lose on
                        2022 edition of the World Cup.</p>

                    <h4>Argentina's recovery and rise to the top</h4>
                    <p>After having a hard start on the World Cup, they raised against Poland and Mexico to come out
                        first of the entire group. After coming out on top, Argentina would face their hardest enemies
                        so far in the World Cup. The hardest of them, not counting the final of course, was the match
                        against the Netherlands. The match was leaning very much in favor of "La Escaloneta", as it was
                        minute 73 and Lionel Messi had just scored the second goal of the match, to leave the game 2-0
                        in favor of Argentina's national team; nonetheless, Weghorst would quickly change the confidence
                        of Argentina after making 2 goals in minutes 83 and 101, which would tie the match again. Only
                        in the penalty shootout would Argentina manage to win the match 4-3.</p>

                    <h4>The grand finale</h4>
                    <p>Even though the match against the Netherlands had already been hard enough, it was about to get
                        worse, when facing the defending World Champion, France. Much like the match against the
                        Netherlands, this game was leaning much in favor of "La Escaloneta". They had major control of
                        the ball for most of the match, they had manage to make two goals in the first half of the game,
                        and they didn't seem to be slowing down their pace to give any chance to France. This made all
                        the more surprising, when it just 2 minutes (80 and 81), Kylian Mbapp√© managed to even the field
                        scoring two goals in the Argentinian net. This forced the game into overtime.</p>
                    <p>In overtime, the game maintained its heartstopping speed and quality. France had regain strenght
                        and confidence, it wasn't a game controlled by Argentina anymore, and they were both making
                        strong attacks on the opposing teams. In this interesting and tight playing field, Lionel Messi
                        managed to score a goal for Argentina in minute 108. With just 12 minutes left for the end of
                        the match, the game felt as if it was already resolved, and we had a clear winner, but just in
                        the nick of time, in minute 118 Kylian Mbapp√© managed to score yet another goal to put the game
                        back at odds. This was the goal that forced the game to go into penalty shootout. In the penalty
                        shootout, Argentina manage to win and conquer the World Cup 4-2, giving Messi what he had always
                        wanted, a World Cup in his career. You can check the highlights of the final, on <a

                            team, which earned him more time on the team, and allowed him to give an excellent performance
                            from that point forward. He earned the prize to the best young player of the world cup. You can

        <h1>The Premier League, the best football league in the World!</h1>
        <div class="rowOne first">
        <p>The Premier League (legal name: The Football Association Premier League Limited) is the highest level of the
            men's English football league system. The Premier League is the most-watched sports league in the world,
            broadcast in 212 territories to 643 million homes and a potential TV audience of 4.7 billion people. For the
            2018–19 season, the average Premier League match attendance was at 38,181, while its an aggregated
            attendance across all matches is the highest of any association football league at 14,508,981. The Premier
            League ranks first in the UEFA coefficients of leagues based on performances in European competitions over
            the past five seasons as of 2021. The English top-flight has produced the second-highest number of UEFA
            Champions League/European Cup titles, with five English clubs having won fourteen European trophies in
            total.</p>

        <h2>History of the Premier League</h2>
        <p>Despite significant European success in the 1970s and early 1980s, the late 1980s marked a low point for
            English football. Stadiums were deteriorating and supporters endured poor facilities, hooliganism was rife,
            and English clubs had been banned from European competition for five years following the Heysel Stadium
            disaster in 1985. By the turn of the 1980s, the downward trend was starting to reverse. At the 1990 FIFA
            World Cup, England reached the semi-finals; UEFA, European football's governing body, lifted the five-year
            ban on English clubs playing in European competitions in 1990, resulting in Manchester United lifting the
            UEFA Cup Winners' Cup in 1991.</p>
        <p>At the close of the 1990–1991 season, a proposal was tabled for the establishment of a new league that would
            bring more money into the game overall. The Founder Members Agreement, signed on 17 July 1991 by the game's
            top-flight clubs, established the basic principles for setting up the FA Premier League. The competition was
            founded as the FA Premier League on 20 February 1992. The newly formed top division was to have commercial
            independence from The Football Association and the Football League, giving the FA Premier League licence to
            negotiate its own broadcast and sponsorship agreements.</p>

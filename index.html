        <h1>Football, the best sport ever!</h1>
        
        <div class="rowOne first">
        <p>This is merely a recreational page created to remark the football world cup and some of the most competitive
            football leagues in the world. Specifically the Premier League, the Serie A, and La Liga. I chose those
            three, because those are my three favorite football leagues, and I try to follow all of them, especially the
            Premier League. I follow a lot of Premier League matches on a weekly basis, as it is the most competitive
            league in the world, it's very entertaining, and what I like the most about it, is that every season can
            come with a lot of surprises. The best example I can think of that is Leicester's amazing campaing to win
            the Premier League 2015-2016. The Leicester made it into the Premier League in 2014, it barely managed to
            hold its status as a Premier League member in that same season, and just one season after (2015-2016), they
            managed to take the 1st place home.</p>

        <h2>Why is this page about football? Why not a different sport? Why not about several sports?</h2>
        <p>Well, the reason is rather simple for me. Some of the Football is more than just a game to me - it's a
            passion that I can't get enough of. From the smell of freshly cut grass to the sound of the roaring crowd,
            there's nothing quite like the thrill of being on the field or cheering on my favorite team. I've been a fan
            of football for as long as I can remember, and every match is an opportunity to witness the incredible
            skill, strategy, and athleticism of the players.</p>
        <p>Whether I'm watching a match from the comfort of my own home or standing in the midst of a raucous stadium
            crowd, I feel a sense of excitement that's hard to match. I love the camaraderie of being part of a team,
            the challenge of competing against opponents, and the satisfaction of seeing my favorite players execute a
            perfectly crafted play. Football is a sport that brings people together and inspires us all to strive for
            greatness, and I'm grateful for the joy and fulfillment it brings to my life.</p>

        <h2>My personal history with indoor football</h2>
        <p>I started playing indoor football when I was 4 years old with my 9-year old brother. This is how my journey
            begin with big challenges from facing people who were bigger and better than me at playing indoor football.
            From there on, I continued playing indoor football through my entire childhood within my community, in my
            school, at local football fields, and quite frankly, everywhere I could get a ball and two goals for
            goalkeepers to defend, even if it was an improvised goal, like two medium-sized stones at the beach to
            function as the goal posts.
            <p>I was on the highschool competition team for indoor football, even though I didn't made it that far
                competing with the highschool team. Simultanously, for 3 years I was part of a regional indoor football
                team (Club Miramar), where we participated in several tournaments, even making it into regional
                semifinals once. For a year after that, I was part of a regional field football (Unión Atletico Falcón)
                in Punto Fijo, until I moved to Caracas to study electronical engineering in Universidad Simón Bolívar.
                In the university, I didn't have the time or resources to be part of the official university team, but I
                was training with the field football university team.</p>
            <p>Eventually, I moved out of Caracas to Bogotá, where I've led a live dedicated mainly to work and
                investing in stocks, which allows for a lot less time for playing football, indoor or field, or any type
                for that matter. Besides, Bogotá's altitude makes it complicated to perform intensive excercise as it
                makes air very thin and hard to breathe.</p>
            </div>
                
            <div class="rowTwo">
            <h2>So, is that where it all ended?</h2>
            <p>Well, not exactly. While it is true that breathing and making intensive excercise and cardio is very hard
                in Bogotá, I still continue to playat least once a month on a nearby indoor football court. But more
                than that, I spent a lot of time now following up on the Premier League, the UEFA Champions League, the
                UEFA Europa League, the FA Cup, the Carabao Cup, the Serie A, La Liga, and even the Bundesliga (although
                considerably less than all the previously mentioned). Football is a passion for me, whether watching it,
                or being actively playing, I can safely say that I will never completely unlink myself from the
                beautiful world of football.</p>
